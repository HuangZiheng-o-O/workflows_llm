 **IMPORTANT:** The original repository I forked from had limited functionality and workflows, and it was unable to work correctly.

This repository [https://github.com/HuangZiheng-o-O/workflows_llm](https://github.com/HuangZiheng-o-O/workflows_llm) is fully functional and includes more features! The files highlighted in orange indicate what the original repository lacked.

You can easily run the workflow using:

1. YAML files
2. openrouter.ai APIs
3. Fabric-like patterns

 
1. use "poetry" to install env
```
poetry install
```
2. 

```
poetry run streamlit run app_web.py
```
